The issue of trust in social networks and e-commerce has always attracted much attention.
With the popularity of social networks in recent years, their real social networks and 
trust relationships have begun to receive attention, and various e-commerce activities 
based on social networks have gradually become a new development trend. Therefore, the 
study of trust between users is of great significance for e-commerce based on social networks.
In the paper, two classic cryptographic structures, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and 
WoT (Web of Trust), are introduced. It also compares them with the principle of human-to-human 
trust generation, and concludes that future cryptography is more likely to be dominated by 
a cryptographic system such as WoT. In addition, a user-centered trust architecture in social 
networks is investigated. The method is based on Web of Trust, which categorizes the trust 
between users in social networks into different levels, and then connects different pairs 
of mutually trusted users to each other to form a larger social trust network. Finally, 
the rationality and effectiveness of the method are verified by searching literature and 
simulation experiments.
