Existing public key cryptography (PKI) technology is built on PKI, which is a kind of 
infrastructure that supports public key management and provides "public key certificate" 
issuance and authentication services\cite{b5}. Users can utilize the security services provided 
by the PKI platform to realize and develop a variety of public key cryptography-based 
security functions and applications\cite{b6}. It can be said that PKI framework has become the 
cornerstone of modern Internet and the foundation of trustworthiness, however, the 
existing PKI framework is dominated by the government and companies, PKI-based public 
key management is far from being popularized and used in the Internet, especially at 
the level of ordinary users, PKI is still seldom accepted, which restricts the realization 
of the needs of the general public for privacy protection and other security services\cite{b4}. 
PKI architecture cannot be popularized because\cite{b2}: 
\begin{enumerate}[]
    \item real-name authentication of users completes the issuance of public key certificates, which violates the principle of anonymity of the Internet; 
    \item the cost of fees is too high for the general public;
    \item it does not provide storage and access services for certificates.
    \end{enumerate}
\\
Another public key management technology is the WoT architecture, which is a credit 
network spontaneously formed by users in the Internet and a technology for public key 
exchange between friends that users know or trust\cite{b4}. However, also due to the looseness 
of this type of organization, it is not widely used\cite{b3}.
